      <p><strong>Infectious Disease Hazards:</strong> Malaria and Yellow Fever were common in this region in the 19th century, and has since between controlled in the 20th century. Occasional Cholera outbreaks in the 19th century in poorly sanitized, densely populated areas (not much of a risk today).

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Dixonia is a nation formed from the Union States in 1865. It operated as a confederacy for most of its life, but has recently shifted towards a federal republic, much like its northern counterpart. The economy of Dixonia is shaped by its industrial and agricultural roots, as well as a recent push towards investment in education, innovation, and infrastructure. The leaders and citizens of Dixonia have an immense sense of pride in their nation, which pushes them to compete and remain relevant as one of the World’s superpowers. Currently, Dixonia is one of the largest economies by GDP and is encouraging an era of innovation and development. Investment in education has led to a rise in public debt, but it remains lower than in many leading nations.</p>
