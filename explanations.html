    <!-- Country Overview Section -->
    <div class="fact-block">
      <h2>Country Overview (Explanations)</h2>
      <p><strong>Country Name:</strong> Inspired by the historical name for the southern states, "Dixie Land," an homage to the region's cultural identity and roots in Southern tradition. Note that the flag includes 11 stars, reflecting the 11 founding states of the Confederacy.</p>
      <p><strong>Government Type:</strong> Originally founded as a confederacy with a strong emphasis on state independence and decentralized power. Over time, the need for greater unity, economic coordination, and international relations led a transition to a federal republic like its northern counterpart. Today, the legislature is continuously reworked to maintain a balance between a centralized government and independent states.</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Dixonia’s location is based on an alternate timeline in which the South successfully seceded from the United States after the Civil War, with an agreement to abolish slavery. Its location, neighbors, and resources are all determined by the 11 included founding states (see map).</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Geography Section -->
    <div class="fact-block">
      <h2>Geography (Explanations)</h2>
      <p><strong>Size in Area:</strong> Estimated using the land area of the current 11 states (see map).</p>
      <p><strong>Size in Population:</strong> Estimated using the population of the current 11 states (see map), while also factoring in potential migration changes and policy differences from the current U.S.</p>
      <p><strong>Natural Hazards:</strong> Gathered from research on the current southern states of the U.S., specifically the hurricane and tornado threats, and how global warming plays into them.</p>
      <p><strong>Infectious Disease Hazards:</strong> Gathered from research on the history of the southern states of the U.S. and their climate. Some notable events in the area's history include Malaria and Yellow Fever in the 19th century, occasional Cholera outbreaks in the 19th century in poorly sanitized, densely populated areas (which is now a much lower risk), and the recent COVID-19 outbreak that ravaged the community. I also used the political affiliation/tendencies of the southern states to determine that their risk is increased due to people choosing to be unvaccinated more often (cultural difference) and the prevalence of underlying chronic health conditions in the population.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Demographics Section -->
    <div class="fact-block">
      <h2>Demographics (Explanations)</h2>
      <p><strong>Median Age:</strong> Based mainly on the current U.S. average, while also accounting for a very slight cultural expectation in the south that pushes people to have children at a younger age.</p>
      <p><strong>Population Growth Rate:</strong> Based originally on the U.S. growth rate. From there, the rate has been elevated due to the higher fertility rate in the southern states (Dixonia likely has enticing opportunities promoting births to combat an aging population). Additionally, I expect Dixonia to transition from a rural to an urban population density. This means more cities are popping up, drawing in people from the rural midwestern areas of the Northern states.</p>
      <p><strong>Net Migration Rate:</strong> Based on the U.S. data, natural beauty, stable government, job opportunities, and location. Dixonia is a very desirable place to be, with a culture promoting individual success and achievement. People from across the globe can come here to build a life for themselves and enjoy the hot weather.</p>
      <p><strong>Life Expectancy at Birth:</strong> Based on U.S. data first, and then two competing hypotheticals are factored in. Dixonia likely has a less monopolized healthcare system, which would ease access and treatment for its citizens. Working opposite, the prevalence of chronic diseases is much higher in southern states, leading to earlier and more frequent deaths.</p>

    <!-- Economy Section -->
    <div class="fact-block">
      <h2>Economy (Explanations)</h2>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> I’ve really aimed to create the economy of a hypothetical nation that would have formed if the South had successfully seceded from the United States after the Civil War. I’ve based most of my research and statistics on the current United States, with a blend of history from the Confederacy. I’ve also aimed to incorporate some of the South’s cultural identity and influence. Some historical events that might have hypothetically had an impact on Dixonia are the Civil War (specifically how it led to independence), the post-WWII prosperity and era of modernization, and Dixonia’s hypothetical education and technological investment boom. The Civil War impacted Dixonia’s sense of nationalism and its belief that it could remain at the top and compete with its neighbors to the north. The era of modernization helped Dixonia diversify its economy and step away from complete reliance on the agricultural sector. Their education and technology investment boom is based on the idea that, due to their intense sense of pride, they’ve realized in order to compete with big nations, they need innovation. All in all, I’ve landed on an economy that has historically relied on the agriculture and energy industries, which has since caused panic and a shift towards investment in innovation and the future generation. I’ve also used history to determine that Dixonia likely would have had less nationwide governance than the current United States, so many of my policy decisions and explanations also take that into account. Hopefully, you enjoy this creative country, which is almost like a thought exercise and a fun “what-if” situation!</p>
      <p><strong>Principal Natural Resources:</strong> Information on the principal natural resources was gathered from research on the current and past natural resources available within the 11 current states that make up Dixonia. Oil and natural gas from Texas and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, Coal from the Appalachia regions of Tennessee, Virginia, and Alabama, and Timber from Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and parts of Texas.</p>
      <p><strong>Principal Crops and Animal Products:</strong> The principal crops and animal products were also gathered from research on the current and past crop/animal products available and harvested in the 11 current states that make up Dixonia. Due to the large rural population and the nation's extensive territory, I predict that the agricultural sector will be relatively advanced and well-invested in, with a significant portion of its exports coming from it.</p>
      <p><strong>Expenditures on Education:</strong> I think it is likely that this country will spend about 6% of its annual GDP on education. Slightly higher than the current US, Dixonia would be more invested in the success of the future generations and wants to ensure it remains a desirable place to live for families to promote population growth and encourage consistent innovation.</p>
      <p><strong>Real GDP per Capita:</strong> Determined to likely be roughly the same as the current USA. I placed it here for two main reasons, after researching them. The first is that there is a weaker economy overall in the South, with significantly less diversification and a lack of advanced services like finance, tech, and biotech that the rest of the U.S. has. The second reason, which pushes in the opposite direction, is that Dixonia spends a bit more on their education and believes strongly in the next generation. With a more educated workforce comes higher levels of innovation and technology, and thus higher economic output.</p>

            <td>Dixonia has a strong economy rooted in its energy production and manufacturing, due to its readily available oil and natural gas resources. A significant portion of their GDP comes from producing, manufacturing, and shipping energy. Agriculture also plays a key part due to the nation’s vast fertile lands and favorable farming conditions. As technology advances and the world progresses, the major industry in Dixonia has shifted from agriculture towards services, specifically finance, tourism, and healthcare. As the population grows, so does the demand for these services. Many of the nation’s jobs come from this sector.</td>

            <td>Credit Rating</td>
            <td>In 2000, Dixonia could still be categorized as a “developing” nation, with limited credit history available and the uncertainty that naturally comes with it. By 2025, Dixonia would likely earn a higher rating due to its diversification, development, and successful fiscal & monetary policy. Considered a stable country financially, but limited by its public debt and regional disparities in output diversification (rural areas are mostly farmland and account for large portions of the nation).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Gini Coefficient</td>
            <td>I landed at a somewhat middle-of-the-road value, having increased since 2000. Dixonia started as a largely agricultural economy with significant regional divides, meaning income disparity was skewed towards the few cities. Since 2000 (and really throughout history), more people have been flocking to the cities of Dixonia, allowing the income disparity to decrease slowly. There is still moderate inequality, but progress is being made through increased spending on public education, growth in the services sector, and population redistribution.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Public Debt</td>
            <td>Starting in 2000 at a more moderate level, reflecting the ideals of the Confederacy of limited federal role and a focus on regional/statewide governance. Dixonia likely maintained a traditional-style economy for most of its life, with few large-scale investment projects from the government. By 2025, Dixonia has shifted its governing style to embrace the era of modernity. Much of the increase in debt can be attributed to Dixonia’s push to remain innovatively competitive with leading nations by increasing spending on education, as well as its efforts to subsidize/encourage diversification of its service sector and reduce income inequality.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Taxes and Other Revenues</td>
            <td>Their level of taxes in 2000 was moderate to low, based on the historical philosophy of the Confederate states having fairly conservative fiscal policies and a limited federal role. Since 2000, staying consistent with the shift in national priorities, the tax level has increased. This is due to increased spending on education, infrastructure, and rural development. Despite the rise, Dixonia likely collects slightly below-average taxes to stay true to its historical founding values.</td>

    <!-- Industrial & Employment Section -->
    <div class="fact-block">
      <h2>Major Industries and Employment (Explanations)</h2>
      <p><strong>Major Industries:</strong> Determined by the same measures that determined natural resources, as well as a bit of historical research on what sectors the Confederacy leaned towards. Stays consistent with the natural resources available in the region, as well as some of the industrial resources available in the rural regions of America today.</p>
      <p><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> I settled on this value based on the U.S. value and because the main industries (agriculture and energy) are likely to have steady employment figures. Additionally, some of the more rural areas of the nation likely have job scarcity. Thus, I’ve landed at a similar rate to the U.S., but a little higher due to the nation's significant rural sprawl.</p>
      <p><strong>Exports (Partners & Commodities):</strong> Dixonia likely has good relations with Mexico due to proximity, China due to their demand for agricultural goods, the EU due to mutual trade benefits, Canada due to their enormous energy and manufacturing sectors, and Japan. I doubt they would have strong relations with the Northern United States due to high tensions created by their secession (no violence or bad blood at the moment, though). Their commodities are based on their geography and principal natural resources/crops available to the region previously discussed.</p>
      <p><strong>Exports (Value):</strong> Estimated to be high because Dixonia has a significant foothold in the global agriculture industry, exporting agricultural goods(cotton, soybeans, poultry), energy (oil, natural gas, renewables), and manufactured goods (cars, aerospace, chemicals) to many nations. Its largest trade partners are Mexico, China, the European Union, Japan, and Canada (note that they likely do not have a good relationship with the northern U.S. due to their secession).</p>
      <p><strong>Imports (Partners & Commodities):</strong> Dixonia likely relies heavily on other nations for many of its consumer goods, as well as most of the intermediate goods involved in its production system. They likely have strong ties with China and Japan, due to their ability to produce goods cheaply and quickly. Also, relations with the EU are likely to be in good condition, as Dixonia exports many of the needed agricultural and energy products while importing high-tech machinery, vehicles, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p><strong>Imports (Value):</strong> Dixonia likely imports a great deal due to their need for key inputs in their manufacturing processes (computers, electronics, machinery, vehicles, etc.). Their focus on expanding the middle class in an increasingly consumeristic world has created import demand from nations where consumer goods can be produced at lower costs, such as China and Japan.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Environmental Section -->
    <div class="fact-block">
      <h2>Environment (Explanations)</h2>
      <p><strong>Carbon Dioxide Emissions:</strong> I think Dixonia would have a very high level of carbon dioxide emissions, largely due to the major fossil fuel producers and extractors located in the Texas and Louisiana regions. The use of heavy vehicles to transport agricultural goods nationwide increases emissions, along with the very energy-intensive agriculture and manufacturing sectors.</p>
      <p><strong>Energy Consumption per Capita:</strong> I think Dixonia would also have a very high level of energy consumption per capita. There are a few reasons I researched for this. First, the climate is very hot and humid, which elevates the need for air-conditioned homes and buildings. Second, there are very long distances between cities, elevating the need for personal transportation vehicles. Third, the industrial and agricultural sectors of the area are known for consuming copious amounts of energy through electricity, diesel, and natural gas.</p>
      <p><strong>Current Environmental Issues:</strong> I based the majority of my answer here on the hypothetical industries I created for Dixonia, along with their excessive CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and natural disasters. It’s very likely, given that Dixonia has been cultivating the land for decades, that deforestation is an issue. Global warming, due to fossil fuel dependence and air pollution, is almost a no-brainer in this situation, given the CO2 emissions and energy consumption. I also mentioned natural disasters specifically due to the southern U.S.’s problems with hurricanes. It’s almost every year that I hear about the southern coast being shredded by unpredictable weather events that likely pose a large threat to the nation.</p>
      <p><strong>International Environmental Agreements:</strong> For this statistic, I mainly researched similar countries in the World Factbook, looked at what each agreement means, and determined if Dixonia would support them. I also aired on the side of involvement, simply because I predict that Dixonia is in the process of freaking out about the environment. Many of the things they rely on produce a ton of emissions and consume a lot of electricity, so I expect them to soon, if not already, implement legislation encouraging environmentally friendly practices.</p>
